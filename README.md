## Predicting Restaurant Closure With Yelp
This is the final project for the NYU Center for Data Science graduate course DSGA-3001 Introduction to Machine Learning.
As a group, we explore different parameters that affect restaurant closures in the US by using machine learning techniques, such as Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, and a Random Forest model.
